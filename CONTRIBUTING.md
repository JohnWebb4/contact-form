# Contributing

I was mainly doing this for my own learning.

Contributing is always encouraged.

Feel free to put up a pull request if you want to contribute.

## Requirements

- There must be no errors or warnings in  linter. `npm run lint`
- If you are fixing a bug, you must add a unit test that currently passes and would have broken before the fix.
